<h1 align="center">Desert Habitat</h1>
<p align="center">Our desert habitat allows visitors to get an up close look at 3 Camels and 2 Peccaries. The desert habitat is just perfect for our Camels and our Peccaries!
    <br>
    The camels are mostly calm and like to wander around, they are all pretty sweet! Our 2 Peccaries are not always the quietest, but they are all around amazing animals.</p>

<h3>The Camels</h3>
<h3 align="right">The Peccaries</h3>
<p>The camels we have were gifted to us from a near-by zoo that ended up closing down, these friendly guys needed a new home.
    <br>
    The names of our camels are, "Emma", "Marco", and their child that is named "Riley".</p>
<p align="right"> Our two Peccaries were rescued as babies, they were found together and alone. We never found the mother or the siblings; if there were any.
    <br>
    Although they have been in captivity their whole lives, they still keep their natural instincts
    <br>
    like knowing how to root up the ground for fungi, roots, and bulbs. Their names are, "Milo" and "Ivan".</p>
